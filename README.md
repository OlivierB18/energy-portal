## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Netlify Dev (frontend + `/.netlify/functions/*`).

If you only need the Vite UI server, use:
```bash
npm run dev:vite
```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` folder.

## Recommended Workflow (Local + GitHub Agents)

Use this setup so your work is always backed up on GitHub and agent changes stay easy to merge.

Current repository convention:
- Canonical branch for this project is `master`.
- Open Pull Requests into `master`.

1. Sync your local repo with the default branch before starting:
```bash
npm run git:sync
```

2. Start a feature branch for your work:
```bash
npm run git:start -- feature/short-description
```

3. Commit and push small changes frequently:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: short description"
git push -u origin feature/short-description
```

4. Let GitHub agents work in separate branches and open Pull Requests.

5. Merge via Pull Request, then sync local again:
```bash
npm run git:sync
```

6. Verify that the PR branch or commit is really in `master`:
```bash
# By branch name (origin/<branch>)
npm run git:verify-merge -- -Branch copilot/fix-empty-electricity-usage-chart

# Or by commit SHA
npm run git:verify-merge -- -Commit 2e63e7b
```

Rules of thumb:
- Keep your own work and agent work on different branches.
- Do not work directly on `master`.
- Merge everything through Pull Requests.
- Never commit `.env` files.
